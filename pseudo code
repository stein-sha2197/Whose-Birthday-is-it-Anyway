Pseudo code to get a program up and running. Once I learn Kivy better I can develop the app display. 
*the app version, I'd like a calendar display

greeted, told who's birthday is today, and given a menu of options
add contact, update a wishlist, search contacts, quit
Add contact: Creates an object. Name & pronouns, picture, birthday, address, phone, email, social handles, likes & favorite things, previous birthday gifts, wish list.
*When viewed in the app, I want the contact object to display like a social profile page. 
stores contact in contacts dictionary (probably)
after contact is stored, user is directed back to menu
Update a wishlist: search contacts by name, pulls up wishlist, and adds item to wishlist, quits to menu
Search contacts: search contacts by name, birthday, address, phone, email, social handles, likes, wish list, and previous birthday gifts. Default is name.
quit: displays goodbye message
